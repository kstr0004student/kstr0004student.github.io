      The notion of the “meme” was introduced by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins
    in the late 1970s as a way to describe what he called a “cultural gene.” Memes are units
    of culture and behaviour which survive and spread via imitation and adaptation.
    Examples of memes are dances, catchphrases, greetings, hairstyles. On the internet, they
    can be pictures of cute cats, images of unicorns, they can be Rick Astley videos, or
    perverse sexual images. Memes play a distinct role in protest; they seem to be the
    resistance of today, just as “political posters” were yesterday—the embodiment of shared
    ideas in a community. They can be JPEGs, or rumours. Indeed, part of their appeal is that
    memes seem to spread spontaneously. Paul Mason, the BBC’s traveling chronicler of all
    things crisis-related, found that “with the internet [...] and above all with the advent of
    social media, it’s become possible to observe the development of memes at an
    accelerated pace [...]. What happens is that the ideas arise, are immediately ‘market
    tested’, and then are seen to either take off, bubble under, insinuate themselves into the
    mainstream, or, if they are deemed no good, disappear.” Mason contends that “[for]
    activists, memes create a kind of rough alternative to representative democracy.” But he
    seems unsure as to their potential for permanence; are they anything more than “small
    cultural portions of zeitgeist”?

  There are three qualities which define the success of memes: longevity, fecundity,
and copying-fidelity. Longevity indicates how long a meme can last. Fecundity applies to
the appeal of a meme, whether it is catchy and thus likely to spread. Copying-fidelity is
about the strength of a meme to withstand mutation in the process of copying and
imitation. It determines how much of the original core remains intact when the meme is
in transmission. All three criteria also apply to jokes, but the joke was not mentioned by
Dawkins as an example of a meme.
</p>
<p>
  Some suggestions in this direction were made, however, by the cognitive scientist
Douglas Hofstadter, a friend of Dawkins. Hofstadter was convinced that memes looked a
lot like self-referential patterns, which would render them not only survival-minded and
selfish—but also fundamentally absurd. An example of such self-referentiality is the
Epimenides Paradox. The Cretan thinker Epimenides stated that “All Cretans are liars.”
The intricacies of this message, which says, “this statement is false,” were explored by
Hofstadter in his seminal book, Gödel, Escher, Bach. Hofstadter brought memes to the
attention of the readership of the Scientific American by the early 1980s, right before the
idea caught on with the general public. Jeremy Trevelyan Burman reconstructs: “In
January of 1983, Hofstadter published an essay that directly discusses his interpretation
of the memes proposal. This was inspired, he said, by letters from readers of his previous
columns—in particular, letters from Stephen Walton and Donald Going, who suggested
that self-referential sentences of the sort discussed in Gödel, Escher, Bach (e.g., ‘This
sentence is false’) could be described as being afflicted by a kind of meaning-virus: selfreference parasitizes language, makes it inconsistent with itself, and then encourages thereader (as carrier) to find or construct new instances of meaning-breaking selfreference.”
</p>
<p>
  As Burman notes, “[both] Walton and Going were struck by the perniciousness of
such sentences: the selfish way they invade a space of ideas answer manage, merely by
making copies of themselves all over the place, to take over a large portion of that space.
Why do they not manage to overrun all of the space? It is a good question. The answer
should be obvious to students of evolution: the sentences do not do so because of
competition from other self-replicators.”
</p>
<p>
Memes are not phenomena of language; they are phenomena with language. From
words which simply “annotate” a meme, conveying its minimally required meaning in a
given context, to words which become an integral part of the meme’s functioning. The
standard internet meme is an image captioned with heavy type, superimposed on it “for
humorous effect” (says Wikipedia). The sentences that are thus part of the image create
some kind of strange loop or self-reference; but they also involve tacit knowledge on the
part of the viewer. An example is the portrait of the Boromir character from the Lord of
the Rings trilogy, captioned with a sentence starting with “One does not simply...” In the
original film, the actor Sean Bean says: “One does not simply walk into Mordor. Its black
gates are guarded by more than just orks.” The “One does not simply...” meme has this
sentence completed in different ways: One does not simply grow his dick six inches in
three easy steps. One does not simply topple a Ugandan warlord by pressing “like” on
Facebook. One does not simply log out of a friend’s Facebook without making him gay.
</p>
<p>
  A fictional, but widely known, point of reference is tinkered with to create new
implications, to the point that one no longer thinks of Tolkien and Peter Jackson at all.
But the remainder of that commonly held reference point, the tacit knowledge which is
that I know that you know that I know that particular part of The Lord of the Rings
enables the joke, any joke, that follows. If, for instance, the same sentence would be
based on a film that no one has ever seen, its mention would never achieve the same
immediate impact. A mem can tap into a collective memory and transform the “outcome”
of a commonly held starting point to different ends.
</p>
<p>
  Further study into the nature of self-referentiality was done by Susan Stewart in
her legendary book, Nonsense. For Stewart, the category of “nonsense” is opposed to the
category of “common sense making” through which what we think of as reality is
established. By categorising something as “nonsense”, “the legitimacy and rationality of
sense making was left uncontaminated, unthreatened. It is not difficult to see a fundamental political procedure at work here. Isn’t it
exactly the day job of most politicians to manage reality and sense-making, deciding
what others get to see as nonsense and what as legit? One is tempted to think here of
Labour leader Ed Miliband’s June, 2011 condemnation of nationwide strikes in the UK.
In a BBC interview, Miliband gave the same answer to each different question posed to
him by the journalist. “These strikes are wrong … both sides should put aside the rhetoric
and get around the negotiating table …” Time and again, Miliband hammered out the
same words. His drone-like repetition of a single, studied phrase laid bare a structural
protocol of governance, an inability to deviate from a script—even more preposterous
when you think that Miliband is supposed to lead the opposition rather than govern the
country. “Milibot,” as the curious speech exercise became known, is an example of what
Mark Fisher subsequently labelled “reality management.” It showed the impossibility of
conducting “opposition” within the governing neoliberal frame, and the desperation of a
politician trying to stan [sic] inside of it. Indeed, argued Stewart, “all discourse bears
reference to a commonly held world. The discourse of common sense refers to the ‘real
world.’ The discourse of nonsense refers to ‘nothing.’ In other words, it refers to itself,
even though it must manufacture this ‘nothing’ out of a system of differences from
everyday world—the common stuff of social life—in order to be recognised as
‘nothing.’”
</p>
<p>
  Nonsense also involves an element of “play.” Boromir’s “One does not simply…”
bounces off from a widely known, and also slightly ridiculous phrase, and then it goes on
to take completely different directions with it. Stewart notes that “Playing at fighting may
not be “not fighting,” but it is not fighting on a different level of abstraction from other
kinds of not fighting such as kissing, skipping rope, buying groceries, or singing “Happy
Birthday.” Play involves the manipulation of the conditions and contexts of messages and
not simply a manipulation of the message itself. It is not, therefore, a shift within the
domain of the everyday lifeworld: it is a shift to another domain of reality.”Memes take on a wide variety of forms and formats, but they do their work right in the human brain. Time, explained Dawkins, constitutes a major limit on the success of individual memes. No one person can do more than only a few things at once .Consequently, said Richard Dawkins, “if a meme is to dominate the attention of the human brain, it must do so at the expense of ‘rival’ memes.” Digital networks and social media do not dissolve the limits in attention that the human brain can give to any meme, but they do more or less solve two out of three criteria that, according to Dawkins, determine a mem’s success: longevity and copyingfidelity.

    How could it be that Dawkins’ most famous book became controversial, but not as a result of what it said? How could its ideas have become the basis of textbooks, yet its arguments be labeled increasingly as revolutionary? The answers to these questions are tied to the reception of its claims: in particular, that genes are selfish—purposefully greedy in the pursuit of their own survival.
  </p>
  <p>
    This interpretation of the book’s argument, as it became increasingly well-known, seemed to justify the self-centeredness of the 19 80s: greed is good, because that’s just how evolution works (see e.g., James 1998, 2008). Yet Dawkins anticipated this reading, and defended against it, even reaching out to the public in a collaboration with the BBC: an episode of Horizon, “Nice guys finish first” (Taylor 1986), laid out his position in clear terms.
  </p>
  <p>
    My purpose here is simply to lay out how the meme’s interminglings came to be: how The Selfish Gene came to imply a selfish meme. But it is not intended to unmix the mixed metaphor (instead, see Henrich, Boyd, and Richerson 2008; Jeffreys 2000). Nor does it attempt to present a history of the idea itself (see Costall 1991). Rather, what follows is intended to contribute to a larger discourse regarding the emergence of meaningful inter-disciplines at the boundary between hard science and human science. In this sense, it is broadly related to the recent examinations of sociobiology (e.g., Jumonville 2002; Li and Hong 2003), social Darwinism (e.g., Weikart 2003), and evolutionary psychology (e.g., Cassidy 2005; 2006). That said, however, it also takes a very different approach. The result is something rather more like a biography of a scientific object, except of course that the meme was never scientific to begin with. In short, therefore, what follows is a story about the construction of meaning through social interaction; how an understanding is shared among minds that are forever situated in their own contexts, having their own interests, and working toward their own ends. It is not a story about the spread of a social infection.
  </p>
  <p>
    To achieve all of this, the essay begins simply by situating the original proposal. What was Dawkins doing when he introduced the meme? I then examine the first major popularization of the meme proposal, in Douglas Hofstadter and Daniel Dennett’s collection The Mind’s I. This leads to an examination of that book’s success in the US and a twopart discussion of the introduction of memes into the American popular understanding. I then move to a similar examination of the idea’s reception in the UK. These parallel stories are put in a larger social context, although briefly, in a four-part analysis of why and how the meme was popularized. And, finally, the essay concludes with a discussion of what these four steps imply for the role of scientific communication in constructing the public understanding of science. 
  </p>
  <p>
   Dawkins’ book merits special attention because it straddles two traditions. As science writer Matt Ridley (2006) recently explained, Before The Selfish Gene, scientists wrote books for each other, or for laymen, but rarely for both”. For Ridley, in other words, the book represents a new species of scientiªc communication. But, as we will see, it wasn’t immediately successful: only in the 1980s did it become a hybrid in the way Ridley now means to celebrate. Thus, in approaching it here, we must first treat it as a particularly  well-written book for scientists.
   Following the synthesis, in the 1930s and 1940s, of Charles Darwin’s theory of natural selection with Gregor   Mendel’s theory of particulate inheritance, the “gene” became the engine of evolution: natural change was conceived as resulting from inheritance and mutation, and nothing more. But this, initially, was a mathematical abstraction; a prediction of theory. When DNA was discovered in the early 1950s, the fundamental assumption of population genetics acquired a material basis. This perspective was then solidified—as the “central dogma” of molecular biology—through work conducted in the 1950s and 1960s. Then, in 1970, when François Jacob published La logique du vivant, une histoire de l’hérédité (translated in 1973 as The Logic of Life), the gene took on its current meaning: Just as a sentence represents a segment of text, so a gene corresponds to a segment of nucleic acid. In both cases, an isolated symbol means nothing; only a combination of symbols has any “sense.” In both cases, a given sequence, sentence or gene, begins and ends
with special “punctuation” marks. (Jacob [1970])
